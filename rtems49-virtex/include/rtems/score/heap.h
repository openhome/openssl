/**
 *  @file  rtems/score/heap.h
 *
 *  This include file contains the information pertaining to the Heap
 *  Handler.  A heap is a doubly linked list of variable size
 *  blocks which are allocated using the first fit method.  Garbage
 *  collection is performed each time a block is returned to the heap by
 *  coalescing neighbor blocks.  Control information for both allocated
 *  and unallocated blocks is contained in the heap space.  A heap control
 *  structure contains control information for the heap.
 *
 *  FIXME: the alignment routines could be made faster should we require only
 *         powers of two to be supported both for 'page_size' and for
 *         'alignment' arguments. However, both workspace and malloc heaps are
 *         initialized with CPU_HEAP_ALIGNMENT as 'page_size', and while all
 *         the BSPs seem to use CPU_ALIGNMENT (that is power of two) as
 *         CPU_HEAP_ALIGNMENT, for whatever reason CPU_HEAP_ALIGNMENT is only
 *         required to be multiple of CPU_ALIGNMENT and explicitly not
 *         required to be a power of two.
