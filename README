openssl

Static library providing OpenSSL's cryptography routines.

To build the OpenSSL cryptography library and package it for a particular platform, call

python create_lib.py <platform> ?debug

where platform is one of:

Windows-x86
Windows-x64
Linux-x86
Linux-x64
Linux-ARM
Core-armv6
Core-ppc32

and debug is an optional flag.


The resulting libraries will be built/installed into a top-level build directory, under a subdirectory of the platform name.

Packages of header files and the libraries themselves will also be placed into the build directory, with names of the form:

openssl-<external_version>-<internal_version>-<platform>-Release.tar.bz2

or, for debug builds:

openssl-<external_version>-<internal_version>-<platform>-Debug.tar.bz2
