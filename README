openssl

Static library providing OpenSSL's cryptography routines.

OpenSSL can be built for the following platforms:

Windows-x86
Windows-x64
Linux-x86
Linux-x64
Linux-ARM
Core-armv5
Core-armv6
Core-ppc32


The library can be built via the create_lib.py script. For example, to generate debug build 999.888.777 for Linux-x86 which is then copied to the artifacts server, the following command would be issued:

python create_lib.py --platform Linux-x86 --configure --clean --build --publish --version 999.888.777 --debug

The resulting libraries will be built/installed into a top-level build directory, under a subdirectory of the platform name.

The '--build' option will also generate a package containing header files and the libraries, which will be placed into the build directory with a name of the form:

openssl-<external_version>-<internal_version>-<platform>-<variant>.tar.bz2

where:
'<external_version>'    is the version of the OpenSSL library on which the release is based,
'<internal_version>'    is a custom version number
'<platform>'            is one of the above platforms
'<variant>'             is 'Debug' or 'Release'


The '--platform' option is always required, while other options can be mixed and matched.
A full list of available options can be accessed by issuing:

python create_lib.py --help
